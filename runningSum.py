#Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
#Return the running sum of nums.
class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            nums[i] = nums[i] + nums[i-1]
        return nums
